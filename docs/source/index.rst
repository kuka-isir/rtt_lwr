Introduction
------------

**rtt_lwr** is a set of components for controlling the Kuka LWR and IIWA at 1Khz.
It relies on OROCOS for the real-time part, but also interfaces with ROS so we can use Rviz, MoveIt, ros-control etc.

It has been designed so researchers/Phd Students/Engineers at ISIR can develop generic controllers for light weight robots and seemlessly switch between simulation/real hardware without the need to recompile their code.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Relatively powerful Ubuntu 16.04/14.04 PC
* Knowledge about ROS
* Notions about OROCOS
